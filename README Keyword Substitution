# It proves to be very useful to show the user what version he/she is running in the about dialog
# therefore, the easiest solution to achieve this is to use keyword substitution.

# To add keyword substitution:
# either, execute the following Git commands:

$ git config filter.rcs-keywords.clean '.git_filters/rcs-keywords.clean'
$ git config filter.rcs-keywords.smudge '.git_filters/rcs-keywords.smudge %f'

# or add the following to ~/.gitconfig:

[filter "rcs-keywords"]
	clean  = .git_filters/rcs-keywords.clean
	smudge = .git_filters/rcs-keywords.smudge %f
